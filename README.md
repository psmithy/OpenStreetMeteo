## About

This is a Python project I started to practice formatting API requests and building command line tools. It might become the basis for more projects later on. ðŸ™‚

## Usage

The API request uses Nominatim's [free form queries](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/#free-form-query)

## Dependencies
